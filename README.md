# Mapping as a Tool for Thought

Presentation I ([@berenguel](https://twitter.com/berenguel)) gave at [Software
Craftmanship and Testing UK 2019 (SoCraTesUK)](https://socratesuk.org).

I recommend you check the version with [presenter
notes](https://github.com/rberenguel/mapping/raw/master/mapping-with-notes.pdf)
which is only available here.

This presentation is formatted in Markdown and prepared to be used with
[Deckset](https://www.decksetapp.com/). The drawings were done on an iPad Mini 5
using [Procreate](https://procreate.art). **Here only the final PDF and the
source Markdown are available**. Sadly the animated gifs are just static images
in the PDF.

You can find an exported version using [reveal.js](http://revealjs.com)
[here](https://rberenguel.github.io/mapping/mapping.html#/). It is
not 100% faithful to the PDF/Deckset version but is close enough (and animated
gifs play). It's also currently showing some weird slides because I have not
implemented a command.
