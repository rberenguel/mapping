# Mapping as a Tool for Thought

Presentation I ([@berenguel](https://twitter.com/berenguel)) gave at [Software
Craftmanship and Testing UK 2019 (SoCraTesUK)](https://socratesuk.org).

I recommend you check the version with [presenter
notes](https://github.com/rberenguel/mapping/raw/master/mapping-with-notes.pdf)
which is only available here.

This presentation is formatted in Markdown and prepared to be used with
[Deckset](https://www.decksetapp.com/). The drawings were done on an iPad Mini 5
using [Procreate](https://procreate.art). **Here only the final PDF and the
source Markdown are available**. Sadly the animated gifs are just static images
in the PDF.

My [Deckset-to-Reveal converter](https://github.com/rberenguel/awkrdeck) is
barfing at something (I suspect it's a too-long footnote right now) so I can't
share an interactive HTML for this (yet, there will be one at some point)
