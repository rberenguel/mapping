^ Yes, the title is borrowed from Iverson's [Notation as a Tool for
Thought](https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Kenneth_E._Iverson#Notation_as_a_Tool_of_Thought_(1979)).

# Tools for thinking

^ The potential of finding new ways to represent what you know is exactly this:
realising what _you don't know_. Mendeleev's periodic table allowed him to
predict the properties of missing elements, such as gallium and germanium

absolutely no concept of movement or any flow of any kind

approximate and relative, but there is no reasonable person that would move
Shoreditch to the bottom left corner

---

![fit](images/Initial-Coffee-Shop-0.png)

^ These are the axes used when drawing a Wardley map. There is a relatively
large list of properties to decide what goes where, but there is a certain
amount of wiggle room for a reason: one big part of a Wardley map is _the
discussion_ that goes into creating it

---

![fit](images/Initial-Coffee-Shop-1.png)

^ You start by placing the user somewhere in the top. Depending on your area of
work, this user could be in either zone, depending on how tight the relationship
might be.

---

![fit](images/Initial-Coffee-Shop-2.png)

^ What are the user _needs_? We have done this exercise already, so it's easy.
Our coffee shop serves quality coffee and in-house produced food

---

![fit](images/Initial-Coffee-Shop-3.png)

^ Food and coffee have needs, which have needs in turn. We go down the further
from the user this is visible

---

![fit](images/Initial-Coffee-Shop-4.png)

^ We get to beans, water (not commodity because the seller of the espresso
machine was very specific) and power. From this map we could already draw some
conclusions: we are getting generic beans to prepare high quality coffee with a
good machine. Doesn't that look like a contradiction?

---

![fit](images/Surroundings-0.png)

^ Now, we could map our surrounding area. This would be an aggregate of all the
close-by coffee shops.

---

![fit](images/Initial-Coffee-Shop-5.png)

^ As you can see, there is a lot of overlap, but there are differences. Now,
plan. What do we want to do? Differentiate? Blend? There is _no right answer_
because it will depend on what you want to do with your business. I.e.
differentiating is good if you don't plan on extending into a franchise: a
franchise wants uniformity with the surroundings. If you plan on staying in the
area only, you probably want to be unique.

---

![fit](images/Initial-Coffee-Shop-6.png)

^ So this is a set of decisions you may want to take. You can decide to go for
more "normal" food to save on costs. You can also move milk to be more of a
centerpiece, even going as far as preparing your own nut milks in-house, or
partnering with a "local" milk provider. You could also ditch the fancy espresso
machine and go for an easier to use machine, to make staff training cheaper and
quicker. You could raise the quality of the beans (even as far as in-house
roasting), or go for geographic-specific water used for the coffees.

---

## There's more

^ But it's hard to fit into a coffee shop theme! Let's get into technology

---

![fit](images/FromWardley-0.png)

^ A company with some web-based system, probably a SAAS, deploying the
applications on some execution platform. Needs compute. Omitted power

---

![fit](images/FromWardley-1.png)

^ A constant force in the market is evolution to commodity. That's because
market pressure will drive _all_ companies in most ecosystems to bring anything
non-core to commodity.

---

![fit](images/FromWardley-2.png)

^ The quientessential example could be _compute_. Where we went from the
Analytical Machine to ENIAC style computers, to data center racks, to cloud, to
serverless. Something similar is happening currently with rocketry, to see
another example. Note though that this doesn't mean _all_ companies do the same.
A consultancy may do a lot of custom work, but for them, that's _core_ work.
Also note that this evolution is pushed back with inertia. Moving to a cloud
faced a lot of inertia, for instance

---

## Climatic __patterns__

#### Or, _how's the weather in your business landscape?_

^ There are a certain amount of commonalities that are shared in all business
landscapes, which you can assume apply to your area unless there is a strong
reason on why they don't

---

[.autoscale: true]

* Everything evolves through supply and demand competition
* Evolution consists of multiple waves of diffusion with many chasms
* You cannot measure evolution over time or adoption
* The less evolved something is then the more uncertain it is
* No choice over evolution
* Commoditisation does not equal Centralisation
* Characteristics change as components evolve
* No single method fits all
* Components can co-evolve
* Efficiency enables innovation
* Higher order systems create new sources of value
* Future value is inversely proportional to the certainty we have over it
* Efficiency does not mean a reduced spend
* Evolution to higher order systems results in increasing energy consumption
* Capital flows to new areas of value
* Evolution of communication can increase the speed of evolution overall
* Change is not always linear
* Shifts from product to utility tend to demonstrate a punctuated equilibrium
* Success breeds inertia
* Inertia increases the more successful the past model is
* Inertia can kill an organisation
* Creative (fast) Destruction
* Competitors actions will change the game
* Most competitors have poor situational awareness
* Economy has cycles

^ This is _on purpose_ unreadable from even a short distance

---

# Doctrine

^ There is a set of rules that you can apply to any business setting _regardless_

---

[.autoscale: true]

* Be transparent
* Focus on high situational awareness
* Use a common language
* Challenge assumptions
* Know your users
* Focus on user needs
* Think fast, inexpensive, elegant and restrained (FIRE)
* Be pragmatic
* Remove bias and duplication
* Use appropriate methods and tools
* Focus on the outcome not a contract
* Use standards where appropriate
* Optimise flow
* Effectiveness over efficiency
* Manage inertia
* Manage failure
* Think small
* Distribute power and decision making
* Provide purpose, mastery & autonomy
* Think aptitude and attitude
* There is no one culture
* Seek the best
* Design for constant evolution
* Use a systematic mechanism of learning
* A bias towards action (do not attempt to create the perfect map)
* Listen to your ecosystems
* A bias towards the new
* Be the owner
* Strategy is iterative not linear
* Do better with less
* Set exceptional standards
* Strategy is complex
* Commit to the direction, be adaptive along the path
* Move fast
* There is no core
* Exploit the landscape
* Think big
* Be humble

^ This is also supposed to be unreadable

![](images/axes.jpg)

# Pick your own __axes__

^ What I like about Wardley maps, is that they open up new ways of seeing and
interpreting reality, they are a tool for thought. New ways of seeing reality
are not rare, but are usually constrained, and you may not be aware of its
existence. [Photo by Jason Abdilla on

![fit](images/Tech-Landscape-0.png)

^ Here's now an example of a type of map that I needed (this will be an
abbreaviated version). First, the axes: size of the potential market and
learning complexity. Basically I wanted to decide where I should focus effort in
my personal technology learning. Right is larger market demand, left is less
market demand. One thing that is not represented but is important for the
consideration is how large of a pool of candidates is already in the market
(there are ways to represent this in 2D, but would make this exposition harder).
This representation helps us form an idea of where we may want to focus our
efforts, which can be seen in the following. Here are the axis, with Python in place

![fit](images/Tech-Landscape-8.png)

![fit](images/Tech-Landscape-9.png)

^ So here's an overview of some tools. I love Scala, but I'm not 100% sure if
it's the right fit for the next 20 years. I already know Python, so, should I
focus on Dask? And, what is happening with Rust?

---

![fit](images/Projects-0.png)

^ Here's an example of personal project allocation. I don't know about you, but
I have _too many_ personal/semi-work related projects. The axes are effort to
master vertically and (immediate) utility in the horizontal. Something can be
utility 0 and "infinite" effort to master (ukulele). Here I add some so you have
an idea. I added lines to link related projects (I have blurred the text for
privacy). Clearly, I had an overbooking of not-that-useful-but-quite-effortful
projects. So, I axed a large deal. The axes. Note that this is
close-but-not-quite a quadrant diagram, because all positioning is relative to
anchors, avoiding having a "0" or a clearly delimited quadrant.

# Summary

* You don't need to _be_ a business to plan like one
* You just need to have a problem, a piece of paper and something to write with
